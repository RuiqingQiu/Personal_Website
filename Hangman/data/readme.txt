Let C(w1,w2) denote the number of times that word w1 is
followed by word w2.  The data files for training, testing,
and validation have a simple three column format: 
C(w1,w2) in column 1, index(w1) in column 2,
and index(w3) in column 3.

The dictionary (linking words to indices) is
given in 60k.words.ascii.
